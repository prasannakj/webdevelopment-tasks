<h3><a href="#">Lucid Dream</a></h3>
A lucid dream is a dream during which the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming. During a lucid dream, the dreamer may gain some amount of control over the dream characters, narrative, and environment; however, this is not actually necessary for a dream to be described as lucid. Lucid dreaming has been studied and reported for many years. Prominent figures from ancient to modern times have been fascinated by lucid dreams and have sought ways to better understand their causes and purpose. Many different theories have emerged as a result of scientific research on the subject and have even been shown in pop culture. Further developments in psychological research have pointed to ways in which this form of dreaming may be utilized as a form of sleep therapy


<h3><a href="#">Etymology</a></h3>
The term 'lucid dream' was coined by Dutch author and psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden in his 1913 article A Study of Dreams, though descriptions of dreamers being aware that they are dreaming predates the actual term. Eeden studied his personal dreams since 1896. He wrote down the dreams that seemed most important to him, and out of all these dreams, 352 were what is now known as “lucid dreams”. He created different names for the different types of dreams he experienced; each name being created from the data he had collected. He named seven different types of dreams: initial dreams, pathological, ordinary dreaming, vivid dreaming, demoniacal, general dream-sensations, and lucid dreaming. Frederick Van Eeden said the seventh type of dreaming, lucid dreaming, was the most interesting and worthy of the most careful observation of studies. Eeden studied lucid dreaming between January 20, 1898, and December 26, 1912. While describing this state of dreaming, Eeden said, 'you are completely aware of your surroundings and are able to direct your actions freely, yet the sleep is stimulating and uninterrupted.'


<h3><a href="#">Risks</a></h3>
Though lucid dreaming can be beneficial to a number of aspects of life, some risks have been suggested. Those who have never had a lucid dream may not understand what is happening when they experience it for the first time. Individuals who experience lucid dreams could begin to feel isolated from others due to feeling different. Someone struggling with certain mental illnesses could find it hard to be able to tell the difference between reality and the actual dream. Long term risks with lucid dreaming have not been extensively studied. Some people experience something like sleep paralysis, which is a state in between dreaming and waking. One experiencing sleep paralysis from sleep cannot move, is aware that they are awake, and yet still may be experiencing hallucinations from their dream. A report in the journal Consciousness and Cognition [63] identifies three common types of hallucinations: an intruder in the room with you, a crushing feeling on your chest or back, and a feeling of flying or levitating. Sleep paralysis is relatively uncommon, with about 7.6% of the general population having experienced it at least once.
